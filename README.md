# PopularMovies
An app for finding popular movie information on your phone.

In order to properly build this in Android Studio, you need to add a file in the res/values directory called api_keys.xml of the format:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="TMDB_request_key">[API_KEY]</string>
</resources>
```
